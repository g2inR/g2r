experiments with R and g2

# g2

The new [g2](https://github.com/antvis/g2) is just too good to not integrate into `R`.  Leland Wilkinson's inspired both `ggplot2` and `g2` so hopefully many of the concepts will translate nicely.

### Facets

Good facetting is what really separates `g2` from nearly all other `JavaScript` visualization libraries.  Definitely have a look at the facetting [examples](https://antv.alipay.com/zh-cn/g2/3.x/demo/index.html#_%E5%88%86%E9%9D%A2).
